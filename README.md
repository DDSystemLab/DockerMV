## Experiments

### TeaStore
The [TeaStore](https://github.com/DescartesResearch/TeaStore) application is a reference application for testing and benchmarking. You can find two version of its Recommender service on our [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/sgholami) page. Also, we used the [teastore.jmx](teastore.jmx) to create a load on the system for our testing purposes.

### Znn
The [Znn](https://github.com/cmu-able/znn) application is used for testing and benchmarking of self-adaptive applications. We created two version of its content-providing component which are available on our [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/alirezagoli) page. Also, we used the [znn.jmx](znn.jmx) to create a load on the system for our testing purposes.
